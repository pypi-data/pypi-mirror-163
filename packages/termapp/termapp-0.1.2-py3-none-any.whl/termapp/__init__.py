"""
``termapp`` provides utilitites to create "terminal applications" using colors,
hide the cursor and replace written content. 

``termapp`` is primarily intended for smaller applications that feature a
dialog based ui (such as package managers, backup scripts, ...). If you want
something more powerful (such as glances) you should go for the great
``curses`` library.
