# Husky_Simplex
Text processing package

Data preprocessing is the first and most essential stage in developing a machine learning
model as it affects the overall accuracy and efficiency of the outcome. Ordinary text data
contains non-contextual words, noise, misspelled words, symbols, punctuations, and
unnecessary syntactic connotations. To circumvent these hindrances, we need to clean
raw text data into data that is acceptable for statistical and computational analysis.

The purpose of the package is to provide a one-stop platform for most of the necessary
text preprocessing techniques. These steps are used to augment the computational
significance of text data for Natural Language Processing tasks.

## Package Functions
1. Tokenization - Converting string input to a list of words.
2. Word counter - Counting the total number of words in the input.
3. Stopword removal - Removing non-contextual words that are only used for the
grammatical structure.
4. Punctuation removal - Removing punctuations.
5. Symbol removal - Removing symbols.
6. Stemming - Removing tense connotations.
7. Bag of words - Quantifying words.
8. Count vectorization - Vectorization of text based on term frequency.
9. TF-IDF vectorization - Vectorization of text based on term frequency in relation to
document frequency
