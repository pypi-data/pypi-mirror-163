# Global Datafeeds Python Library Description

## Reference document for implementing python library of WebSocket API by Global Datafeeds

  
WebSocket API by Global Datafeeds is Versatile, most Modern, simple yet powerful API. This API will provide on demand real time and historical data in JSON format from server. It is Suitable for Web, Mobile as well as Desktop Applications. Below are the list of function and their respective details available in WebSocket API. For more detail Documentation & Support refer to the page by **Global Datafeeds** [here.](https://globaldatafeeds.in/global-datafeeds-apis/documentation-support/documentation/websockets-api-documentation/) <br>

This python library is developed to save time and efforts of clients while working on implementation of WebSocket API of Global Datafeeds. List of functions (Data Requests) available is given below.

# Getting Started

## Installing a Library

Client need to install this library to install the library by issuing the command from python console
```
python3 -m pip install gfdlws
```
or on windows command prompt
```
pip install gfdlws
```
---

## How to Connect using WebSocket API

Once installation is completed client can connect to API server by the code sample given below:
<br><br>**Syntax:**<br>
```
import gfdlws as gw
import sys

con = gw.ws.connect(<EndPoint>, <API Key>)
```
Here in above code sample:

- Endpoint : endpoint is URL like 'ws://endpoint:port'. End point URL and Port number will be provided by Global Datafeeds.

- API Key : This is the key which will be authenticated and once key was authenticated, client can request data by using function given in the above list.

<br>**Response**<br>
If key is authenticated server will send below response in JOSN format
```
{"Complete":true,"Message":"Welcome!","MessageType":"AuthenticateResult"}"
```
---

# Realtime data requests

Client can get real-time data through API. This data will be of two types:

1. Client can subscribe Realtime data and get the data for every second.

2. Client can subscribe Realtime snapshots data, returns data snapshot as per Periodicity & Period values.
---
## SubscribeRealtime
In this client will receive the data with 1 second frequency. This data will start once request is sent and will continue till market is open. Below is the sample code to get this data:
<br><br>**Syntax:**<br>
```
import gfdlws as gw
import sys

con = gw.ws.connect(<EndPoint>, <API Key>)
gw.realtime.get(con,<Exchange>,<InstrumentIdentifier>, <Unsubscribe Optional [true]/[false][default=false]>)
```
<br>**Example**<br>
```
import gfdlws as gw
import sys

con = gw.ws.connect(<EndPoint>, <API Key>)
gw.realtime.get(con,'NSE','SBIN','false')
```
<br>Client will get data for 'SBIN' in response for each second. Sample response is given below. This response will be in JSON format.
<br>**Response**<br>

```
{"Exchange":"NSE","InstrumentIdentifier":"SBIN","LastTradeTime":1658127120,"ServerTime":1658127121,"AverageTradedPrice":484.46,"BuyPrice":487.15,"BuyQty":167,"Close":479.1,"High":487.45,"Low":482.1,"LastTradePrice":487.2,"LastTradeQty":111,"Open":484.55,"OpenInterest":0,"QuotationLot":1.0,"SellPrice":487.2,"SellQty":200,"TotalQtyTraded":4141512,"Value":2006396903.52,"PreOpen":false,"PriceChange":8.1,"PriceChangePercentage":1.69,"OpenInterestChange":0,"MessageType":"RealtimeResult"}
```
---
## SubscribeSnapshot:
In this client will receive real-time Snapshots data, this function returns snapshot data as per Periodicity & Period values provided. This snapshot data will start once request is sent and will continue till market is open. Below is the sample code to get snapshot data:
<br><br>**Syntax:**<br>
```	
import gfdlws as gw
import sys

con = gw.ws.connect(<EndPoint>, <API Key>)
gw.realsnapshot.get(con,<Exchange>,<InstrumentIdentifier>,<Periodicity>,<Period>,<Unsubscribe Optional[true]/[false][default=false]>)
```	
<br>**Example**<br>
```	
import gfdlws as gw
import sys
con = gw.ws.connect(<EndPoint>, <API Key>)
gw.realsnapshot.get(con,'MCX','CRUDEOIL-I','MINUTE','1','false')
```
Client will get data for 'CRUDEOIL' current contact in response for each minute when minute id finished. 'CRUDEOIL-I' is InstrumentIdentifier (Symbol) to understand more about the 'Symbol Naming Conventions' check [here.](https://globaldatafeeds.in/global-datafeeds-apis/global-datafeeds-apis/documentation-support/symbol-naming-conventions/)
<br>Sample response is given below. This response will be in JSON format.
<br>**Response**<br>

```
{"Exchange":"MCX","InstrumentIdentifier":"CRUDEOIL-I","Periodicity":"MINUTE","Period":1,"LastTradeTime":1658139420,"TradedQty":46,"OpenInterest":1494,"Open":7935.0,"High":7939.0,"Low":7935.0,"Close":7939.0,"MessageType":"RealtimeSnapshotResult"}
```

# Historical data requests

## GetHistory:
This will returns historical data as per the periodicity and Period provided in request. Returned dat will be Tick, Minute candle or EOD. Client will get 2 types of response depend on the request
<br>
- Getbyperiod: This request will return the data between the provided period. Client need to provide From time and To time in this call. Below is the sample code to get snapshot data:
<br><br>**Syntax:**<br>
	```
	import gfdlws as gw
	import sys

	con = gw.ws.connect(<EndPoint>, <API Key>)
	gw.history.getbyperiod(con,<Exchange>,<InstrumentIdentifier>,<Periodicity>, <Period>,<From>,<To>,<UserTag>,<isShortIdentifier Optional [true]/[false][default=false]>)
	```

	<br>**Example**
	```
	import gfdlws as gw
	import sys

	con = gw.ws.connect(<EndPoint>, <API Key>)
	gw.history.getbyperiod(con,'NFO','NIFTY-I','MINUTE','1','1658115000','1658138400','dhananjay','false')
	```
  
	Here in this request From and To is a numerical value of UNIX Timestamp like ‘1658138400’ (18-07-2022 15:30:00). This value is expressed as no. of seconds since Epoch time (i.e. 1st January 1970). Also known as Unix Time. Please Visit [Epoch Converter](https://www.epochconverter.com/) to get formulae to convert human readable time to Epoch and vice versa.

	As a response to above call client will get all the 1 minute candle records between provided period.
<br>
- Getcaldle: This request will return the data in number of latest candles. Client need to provide number of candles in this call. Below is the sample code to get snapshot data:
<br><br>**Syntax:**<br>
	```
	import gfdlws as gw
	import sys

	con = gw.ws.connect(<EndPoint>, <API Key>)
	gw.history.getbyperiod(con,<Exchange>,<InstrumentIdentifier>,<Periodicity>, <Period>,<Max>,<UserTag>,<isShortIdentifier Optional [true]/[false][default=false]>)
	```
	<br>**Example**
	```
	import gfdlws as gw
	import sys

	con = gw.ws.connect(<EndPoint>, <API Key>)
	gw.history.getcaldle(con,'NFO','NIFTY-I','MINUTE','1','10','dhananjay','false')
	```

	Here in this request From and To is a numerical value of UNIX Timestamp like ‘1658138400’ (18-07-2022 15:30:00). This value is expressed as no. of seconds since Epoch time (i.e. 1st January 1970). Also known as Unix Time. Please Visit [Epoch Converter](https://www.epochconverter.com/) to get formulae to convert human readable time to Epoch and vice versa.
	As a response to above call, client will get all 10 number of 1 minute candle records. 

<br>Sample response for both the calls is given below. This response will be in JSON format.
<br><br>**Response**<br>
*OHLC Format:*
``` 
{"LastTradeTime":1658138400,"QuotationLot":50,"TradedQty":800,"OpenInterest":11179850,"Open":16312.95,"High":16312.95,"Low":16312.95,"Close":16312.95},

## GetHistoryAfterMarket:
This function returns historical data in the form of Tick, Minute or EOD as per request till previous working day. This function is useful for the users / service providers who want to provide services like back-testing as they do not need live / current day’s data. This should also save their API costs. To receive current day’s historical data via this function, you will need to send request after market is closed. Requests for this function are same as **History.**

import sys

con = gw.ws.connect(<EndPoint>, <API Key>)
gw.exchanges.get(con))
```
 <br>**Example**
```
import gfdlws as gw
import sys

con = gw.ws.connect(<EndPoint>, <API Key>)
gw.exchanges.get(con))
```
Sample reponse is given below. This response will be in JSON format.
