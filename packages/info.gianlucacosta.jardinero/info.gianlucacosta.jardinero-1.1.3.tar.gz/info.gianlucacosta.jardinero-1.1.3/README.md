# Jardinero

_Extensible web application for exploring natural languages_

![(main page screenshot)](screenshots/main.png)

## Introduction

_Natural languages_ are as _sublime_ as exquisite flowers in a garden - and from such a naturalistic simile stems the name of this web application: **Jardinero**, meaning _gardener_.

I definitely needed a tool to perform morphological analysis over the Spanish language - that is, I wanted to find an answer to questions like:

> Why some Spanish words end with -tad, whereas others end with -dad? What are the differences between them, in terms of both morphology and cardinality?

To solve this mystery - and several more - I decided to create Jardinero, a web application extracting my compact SQLite Spanish dictionary from **Wikcionario**, ready for custom SQL queries.

While developing the project, I felt it would be nice to extend the approach to any language, thus creating the whole open source architecture consisting of:

- [Eos-core](https://github.com/giancosta86/Eos-core) - type-checked, dependency-free utility library for modern Python

- [WikiPrism](https://github.com/giancosta86/WikiPrism) - library for parsing wiki pages and creating dictionaries

- [Cervantes](https://github.com/giancosta86/Cervantes) - WikiPrism-based library extracting a compact Spanish dictionary from Wikcionario

- **Jardinero**: hybrid Python/TypeScript web application, with a Flask backend and a React frontend communicating via websockets

As a core aspect, the architecture can be easily _extended_ by creating Python modules and packages named _linguistic modules_.

## Main features

Jardinero's user interface enables users to:

- **create a SQLite dictionary from a wiki file** - whose URL depends on the current linguistic module

- **perform queries** - in SQL or even in a custom DSL - upon the internal dictionary

- **re-create the dictionary**, especially when the data source gets frequent updates

To explore in detail how the overall architecture works, as well as the purpose and the creation process of its components, please consult **my presentation on SpeakerDeck**: [The making of Jardinero](https://speakerdeck.com/giancosta86/the-making-of-jardinero).

## Requirements

Jardinero requires at least **Python 3.10** - available at [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/) or via your operating system's package manager.

## Installation

You can install Jardinero just like any other PyPI package for your Python distribution:

```bash
pip install info.gianlucacosta.jardinero
```

## Running Jardinero

1. Jardinero requires a _linguistic module_ - for example, [Cervantes](github.com/giancosta86/Cervantes/), dedicated to the Spanish language:

   ```bash
   pip install info.gianlucacosta.cervantes
   ```

1. Jardinero should preferably be run with Python's **-OO** and **-m** command-line arguments:

   ```bash
   python -OO -m info.gianlucacosta.jardinero <linguistic module>
   ```

   which, in the case of Cervantes, becomes:

   ```bash
   python -OO -m info.gianlucacosta.jardinero info.gianlucacosta.cervantes
   ```

1. Then, you can just point any browser to http://localhost:7000/

## Running in developer mode

By omitting the **-OO** (and even the **-O**) flag, Jardinero will start in _developer mode_ - which enables additional aspects:

- Flask running with **file watching** enabled

- More fine-grained **logging**

- **HTTP redirection** to the frontend development server

- Python's **\_\_debug\_\_** global variable set to **true** - for example, in this case, Cervantes downloads from localhost and not from Wikcionario's official website

For simplicity, Jardinero's TOML project includes auxiliary scripts:

- Install the frontend as an NPM package:

  ```bash
  poetry run poe install-frontend
  ```

  After that, to start the frontend server during development, you can run:

  ```bash
  poetry run poe start-frontend
  ```

  Alternatively, for better debugging introspection, you can always run **yarn start** on the related project - to start Webpack's dev server

- Python's static HTTP server, serving files from your **$HOME/Downloads** directory:

  ```bash
  poetry run poe start-static
  ```

The above command lines can be further simplified if you add the following alias to your shell configuration - especially **.profile** for Bash:

```bash
alias poe='poetry run poe'
```

Once the above commands have been issued, you can just start Jardinero in development mode:

```bash
python -m info.gianlucacosta.jardinero <linguistic module>
```

and finally open your browser to the usual address - http://localhost:7000/

## Extending Jardinero

Jardinero is designed to be extensible! I created it to explore the nuances of the Spanish language, but it can support arbitrary combinations of parameters:

- **source wiki URL** - provided it points to a BZ2-compressed file

- **term-extraction algorithm** from each wiki page

- **SQL schema** in the SQLite db

It is definitely up to your needs and creativity! 😊

Your _linguistic module_ can be just a Python module (or a package) - within the current Python module search path - containing these functions:

- **get_wiki_url**: a **() -> str** function returning the URL of a BZ2-compressed XML wiki file, which in turn should have the format described in [WikiPrism](https://github.com/giancosta86/WikiPrism) documentation

- **extract_terms**: a **(Page) -> list\[TTerm\]** function, extracting a list of terms from a given wiki page

- **create_sqlite_dictionary**: a **(Connection) => SqliteDictionary\[TTerm\]** function creating an instance of a WikiPrism **SqliteDictionary** from the given SQLite connection. In particular, _it is the Dictionary that actually responds to queries_, so you might want to design your own DSL via a custom subclass.

The exact meaning of **TTerm** depends on your linguistic model: to explore a real-world example, please refer to [Cervantes](https://github.com/giancosta86/Cervantes) - my library dedicated to the analysis of the Spanish language.

## Final thoughts

Jardinero's core point is the web UI for creating and querying custom dictionaries, as well as its extensible engine.

Of course, there are limitations: if you need advanced features like pagination, charts, and even more analysis tools, you can still run Jardinero to create your custom SQL db, that will be stored at:

> $HOME/.jardinero/\<module name\>/dictionary.db

Then, you can also use your favorite database explorer - such as the excellent, open source [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/).
