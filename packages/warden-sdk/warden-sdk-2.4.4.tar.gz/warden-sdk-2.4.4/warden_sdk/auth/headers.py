   Security headers is used after the request function in flask to append security headers necessary to prevent various attacks, mainly man-in-the-middle (MITM). The headers appended are as::

      - Strict Transport Security: Tells the browser to convert all HTTP requests to HTTPS, preventing man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

      - Content Security Policy: Tell the browser where it can load various types of resource from. This header should be used whenever possible, but requires some work to define the correct policy for your site. A very strict policy.

      - X Content Type Options: Forces the browser to honor the response content type instead of trying to detect it, which can be abused to generate a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack.

      - X Frame Options: Prevents external sites from embedding your site in an iframe. This prevents a class of attacks where clicks in the outer frame can be translated invisibly to clicks on your page’s elements. This is also known as "clickjacking".

      - X XSS Protection: The browser will try to prevent reflected XSS attacks by not loading the page if the request contains something that looks like JavaScript and the response contains the same data.

   Args::
      response (dict): Response object from flask before being sent to requester.
