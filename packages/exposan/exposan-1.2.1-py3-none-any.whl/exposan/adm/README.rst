adm: Validation of Anaerobic Digestion Model No. 1
==================================================

Summary
-------
This module is used to validate the implementation of Anaerobic Digestion Model No. 1 (ADM1) [1]_ in QSDsan using a continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR). The implemented algorithms (i.e., ``qsdsan.processes.ADM1`` and  ``qsdsan.sanunits.AnaerobicCSTR`` classes) has been verified against the MATLAB/Simulink implementation with algebraic solutions for H2 and pH developed by Flores-Alsina et al. [2]_ , [3]_.

   *Layout of the system used for the validation of ADM1 implemented in QSDsan*

- ``system.py`` constructs the system above.
- ``model.py`` creates a model with identical parameter settings and influent composition as in Rosen and Jeppsson [3]_ and performs simulations of the system with 100 randomly sampled initial conditions until the steady state is reached.
- ``analyses.py`` processes and plots the simulated time-series data of the system state variables with steady-state values reported in Rosen and Jeppsson [3]_.
