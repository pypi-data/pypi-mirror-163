Fork
====

The original repository and project remained stale for numerous years. No one to blame but ourselves, in those
cases we have to act accordignly and respectfully to every individuals.

I choose to maintain a fork.

Overview
========

Converts a Python dictionary or other native data type into a valid XML string.
This is a fork that support Python 3.9 and forward versions and drop all EOL (<=3.6) versions altogether.
It is mostly backward-compatible, act as a drop-in replacement.
