        ```sh
        # Windows
        cipher or python -m cipher
        
        # Linux and mac
        cipher or python3 -m cipher
        ```
        
        Happy encrypting!
        
        ***Note: the private key is saved in a weird file format, dont try to mess with that or you wont be able to decrypt the content ever again***
