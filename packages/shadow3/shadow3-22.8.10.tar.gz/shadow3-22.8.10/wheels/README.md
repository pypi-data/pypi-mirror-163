Wheels for testing shadow3 
==========================

This directory contains commands for installing shadow3 v 22.8.10 for testing before release.

They have been built using the branch: 
https://github.com/oasys-kit/shadow3/tree/devel-gfortran-yb66


It included changes to compile with new gfortran compilers (thanks Tom Schoonjans)
and calculation of any crystal structure via a new bragg preprocessor file (thanks Xiaojiang Yu).
