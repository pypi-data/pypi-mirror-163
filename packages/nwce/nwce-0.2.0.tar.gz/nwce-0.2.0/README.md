# nwce

*nwce* is a Python library that can parse Cisco configuration files. I wrote it mainly for Nexus devices but it 
should work for any indented configuration files.

## Disclaimer

This library is still in the very early development stages and the API could be broken without notice.

## Getting Started

Tests provide a very good starting point before I start writing the documentation.

### Installing

```
pip install nwce
```

## Running the tests

```
python -v tests/
```
