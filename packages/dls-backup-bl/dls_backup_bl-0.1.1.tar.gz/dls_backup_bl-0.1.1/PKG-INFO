        How to Use
        ----------
        
        All examples here use the beamline i16. Substitute i16 with the beamline name you 
        are working with.
        
        Run these tools on a beamline workstation or provide the 
        beamline name with the command line parameter ``--beamline i16``.
        
        First create a configuration file that describes the devices on the 
        beamline. The following command will allow you to view and edit the
        list of devices that the backup process will manage::
        
            dls-backup-gui
        
        This will open a GUI that will allow you to configure the devices.
        
        Once the configuration is complete you can launch the full backup with::
        
            dls_backup_bl
        
        Note that you can backup a subset of devices like this::
        
            dls_backup_bl --devices BL16I-MO-STEP-01 BL16I-MO-STEP-02
        
        More Help
        ---------
        
        Both tools have help which describes the command line options::
        
            dls-backup-gui --help
            dls_backup_bl --help

        Backup Files
        ------------
        
        All the backup files are stored in ``/dls_sw/work/motion/Backups/BL16I``
        
        The device description file is 
        ``/dls_sw/work/motion/Backups/BL16I/BL16I-backup.json``
        
        There are also log files in this directory. Plus a subfolder for each class
        of backup device.
        
        The backup folder is a git 
        repository and all backups are incremental only. The full history of 
        backups can be retrieved with git commands.
