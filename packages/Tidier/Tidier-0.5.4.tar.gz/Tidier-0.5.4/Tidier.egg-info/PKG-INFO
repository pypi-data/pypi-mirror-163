Tidier is a simple command line tool that helps you make your files tidy up.
Examples will show you the power.


## Examples

After installing Tidier, using it is as easy as your moms cleans your room for you.

**Move** all files inside `pictures` folder to `organized` folder organized by date:

```bash
$ tidier tidy "Pictures" -o "Organized"
```
Log output e.g. `[-] Moving Pictures/IMG_123.jpg to Organized/2018/April/01/IMG_123.jpg`

\
**Copy** all files and organize by their year & **type**:
```bash
$ tidier tidy "Pictures" -o "Organized" -r "%Y/{type}/{name}" --copy
```
Log e.g. `[-] Copying Pictures/IMG_123.jpg to Organized/2018/image/IMG_123.jpg`

\
**Move** all of your favorite show episodes to organized Season seperated folder:
```bash
$ tidier tvshow "Breaking Bad"
```
Log e.g. `[-] Moving Breaking Bad/breaking.bad.S04E03.x265.WEB-DL.mkv to Breaking Bad/Season 4 | x265 WEB-DL/Episode 3.mkv`


\
Also, you can use **Jalali** calendar date:

```bash
$ tidier tidy "Scripts" -r "%y/%B/{name}" --jalali
```
Log e.g. `[-] Moving Scripts/Crawler.py to Scripts/99/Ordibehesht/Crawler.py`

\
You can set **locale** or organize files by their **extension**:

```bash
$ tidier tidy "Valentine" -r "%Y %B/{ext}/{name}" --locale fr_FR
```
Log e.g. `[-] Moving Valentine/Paris.jpg to Valentine/2021 dÃ©c/Paris.jpg`
