class InternalMsgCall(TypedDict):
    """An Ethereum internal message call. Interanl message calls, also called 
    "internal transactions" are value transfers that were initiated by executing 
    a contract. 
    
    Despite the alternate name, internal transactions (which isn't part of the 
    yellowpaper yet still became a convention), internal transactions aren't 
    actual transactions. They're the effects of running some transaction in 
    question on the blockchain state. 
    
    In other words, internal transactions aren't included or stored on the 
    blockchain. Blockchain explorers like etherscan obtain them by 
    running a modified node with an instrumented EVM, which record all the value 
    transfers that took place as part of transaction execution, storing them 
    separately.
