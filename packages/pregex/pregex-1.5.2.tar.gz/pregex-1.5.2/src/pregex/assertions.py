All classes within this module "assert" something about the provided pattern
without having to match any additional characters. For example, :class:`MatchAtStart` ensures
that the provided pattern matches only when it is found at the start of the string,
while :class:`NotFollowedBy` asserts that a match must not be followed by one or more
specified patterns. Another thing you should keep in mind is that assertions cannot be
quantified, as attempting that will cause a ``CannotBeQuantifiedException`` exception
to be thrown. The only exception to this is the :class:`~pregex.quantifiers.Optional`
quantifier.
