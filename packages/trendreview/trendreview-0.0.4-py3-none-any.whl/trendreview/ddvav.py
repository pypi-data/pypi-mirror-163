Logic for fault detection and trend review including dual duct terminal units
See documentation for list of rules covered

Logic
1. Load data into pandas dataframe
2. Apply rules along data (see rules)
3. If a rule check is broken, then raise a custom exception
4. The exception will be caught the the calling function and handed to the
reporting class which logs the broken rule
5. The exception will be handed to a plotting class which will create a plot
of the broken rule, and apply visual formatting. The plot is saved to a
configurable location
6.
