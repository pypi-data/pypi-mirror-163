Description: # Secure-hashing
        A library used for secure password storage. Feel free to look around the source code, there is not a lot. This library also supports peppers, if you don't know what that is i suggest you look at this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepper_(cryptography)
        
        Word of safety: always practice cryptography with great care.

        # Usage
        ```python

        ```

        ```
        Returns a hashed password. Rounds parameter is used to specify how many rounds should be used in salt generation.

        verify_high(password, hash0, pepper="")
        ```
        Returns True if the password matches the hash.
        
        ```python
