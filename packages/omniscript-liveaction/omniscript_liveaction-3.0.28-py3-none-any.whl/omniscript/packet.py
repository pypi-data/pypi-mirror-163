    """The Packet class has packet information.
    The 
    :func:`get_packets() 
    <omniscript.capture.Capture.get_packets>`
    function returns a list of Packet objects.

    Packet number vs index: the packet number, which starts at 0, is a
    counter of the packets as they are captured. When a packet is
    captured the packet counter becomes the packet number of the packet
    and then the packet counter is incremented.
    The packet index is the index into the list of packets called the
    packet buffer.
    The first index in the packet buffer is 0. The first packet in the
    packet buffer, index 0, always contains the packet with the lowest
    packet number.
    
    A capture buffer can only hold a finite number of packets. Once
    the buffer  has filled and a new packet is captured then the
    first packet in the packet buffer (index 0) is deleted makeing what
    was the second packet (index 1) into the first packet (index 0).
    And the newly captured packet becomes the last packet in the buffer.

    The first_packet attribute of a
    :class:`Capture <omniscript.capture.Capture>`
    is the packet number of the first packet in the capture buffer.
