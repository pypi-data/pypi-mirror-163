              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
              and conversions to other media types.        
              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
              copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).        
              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."        
              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.        
              To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
              boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"

SG Otio, an OpenTimelineIO ShotGrid Library
=======

[![Run tests](https://github.com/GPLgithub/sg-otio/actions/workflows/ci.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/GPLgithub/sg-otio/actions/workflows/ci.yaml)

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/GPLgithub/sg-otio/branch/master/graph/badge.svg?token=9X2MDPFCBI)](https://codecov.io/gh/GPLgithub/sg-otio)

A library to represent [OpenTimelineIO](http://opentimeline.io/) data in [ShotGrid](https://www.shotgrid.com),
and vice versa.

Disclaimer
----------

SG Otio is currently in Public Alpha. That means that it may be missing
some essential features and there are large changes planned. During this phase
we actively encourage you to provide feedback, requests, comments, and/or
contributions.


Installation
------------

### SG Python API

The SG Python API is not available on PyPi and must be manually installed
from github, e.g. `pip install git+https://github.com/shotgunsoftware/python-api.git`

### ffmpeg
sg-otio requires ffmpeg to be installed, and ffmpeg must be in the `PATH`.

- Binaries can be downloaded from [FFmpeg download page](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html), in which case the
binaries should be added to the `PATH` environment variable.
- A package manager can be used, for example on MacOS, `brew install ffmpeg`, in
which case the PATH should already be updated by the package manager.

### sg-otio package

SG Otio can only be installed from sources at the moment.
- Get a local copy of this repo: `git clone https://github.com/GPLgithub/sg-otio.git`
- Install it with `pip`: `pip install ./sg-otio`

sg-otio usage
-------------

You can access the help with `sg-otio read --help`, `sg-otio write --help`, or `sg-otio compare --help`. 

### ShotGrid login information

You can provide Shotgrid login information in 3 different ways:
- `--login <username> --password <password>`
- `--script-name <script name> --api-key <api key>`
- `--session-token <session token>`

### Reading a Cut from SG
Read a Cut from SG and either output it in OTIO format or write it to a file. Any format suppported by OpenTimelineIO's standard adapters is supported.

Examples:
```
sg-otio read --sg-site-url URL --session-token TOKEN --cut-id CUT_ID
sg-otio read --sg-site-url URL --session-token TOKEN --cut-id CUT_ID --file output.otio
sg-otio read --sg-site-url URL --session-token TOKEN --cut-id CUT_ID --file output.xml --adapter-name fcp_xml
sg-otio read --settings SETTINGS.JSON --sg-site-url URL --session-token TOKEN --cut-id CUT_ID --file output.xml --adapter-name fcp_xml
```
### Writing a Cut to SG
Write a Video Track to SG as a Cut.
Example:
```
sg-otio write -u URL --session-token TOKEN --entity-type Cut --entity-id CUT_ID --file INPUT.edl --movie INPUT.mov --settings SETTINGS.JSON
```

### Comparing a Video Track to a SG Cut
Read a Video Track from an OpenTimelinio source and compare it to an existing SG Cut.
Any format suppported by OpenTimelineIO's standard adapters is supported for the source.
The video Track can be written to SG as a new Cut by adding the `--write` argument.
The new SG Cut will be linked to the SG Entity the previous SG Cut is linked to.
Examples:
```
sg-otio compare --sg-site-url URL  --session-token TOKEN --file INPUT OTIO --cut-id CUT_ID
sg-otio compare --sg-site-url URL  --session-token TOKEN --file INPUT OTIO --cut-id CUT_ID --write
``` 

### Settings file

Some settings for sg-otio read and write can be stored in a JSON file, and passed
to sg-otio with `--settings[-s] path/to/SETTINGS.JSON`.
This is what such file would contain with the default settings:
```json
{
  "default_head_in": 1001,
  "default_head_duration": 8,
  "default_tail_duration": 8,
  "use_clip_names_for_shot_names": false,
  "clip_name_shot_regexp": null,
  "local_storage_name": "primary",
  "versions_path_template": "{PROJECT}/{LINK}/{YYYY}{MM}{DD}/cuts",
  "version_names_template": null,
  "create_missing_versions": true,
  "timecode_in_to_frame_mapping_mode": 1,
  "timecode_in_to_frame_relative_mapping": ["00:00:00:01", 1001],
  "use_smart_fields": false,
  "shot_cut_fields_prefix": null,
  "shot_omit_status": "omt",
  "shot_reinstate_status": "Previous Status",
  "reinstate_shot_if_status_is": ["omt", "hld"]
}
```

#### Default Head In, Default Head Duration, Default Tail Duration
When creating new Shots in ShotGrid, the values to use for the start frame and handles.

##### Use Clip Names for Shot Names
If set to True, the Clip name will be used as a Shot name if it can't be computed from
locators nor comments in the EDL.

##### Clip Name Shot Regexp
If set, use a regular expression to extract the Shot name from the Clip name.

#### Create Missing Versions
If set to True, for Clips with media references that don't have a version in ShotGrid,
a new version will be created in ShotGrid.

- For an EDL without media references, a movie of the Cut needs to be passed to sg-otio,
which will allow to extract the Versions from the Cut movie.
- For formats like Premiere XML, this means that media references existing in the XML
file will be published to ShotGrid.

#### Local storage name
When creating missing Versions, the SG local storage to use to publish the files to.

#### Versions Path Template
When creating missing Versions, the path to use to publish the files to.

This is a relative path from the local storage chosen.

The following keys are available:
`PROJECT, CUT_TITLE, LINK, HH, DD, MM, YY, YYYY`

Example valid templates:
- `{PROJECT}/{LINK}/{YYYY}{MM}{DD}/cuts (default)`
- `{PROJECT}/{CUT_TITLE}/{YYYY}{MM}{DD}/`

#### Version Names Template
If not specified, the Version name will be the Clip name.
If specified, the Version name will be computed using the template.

The following keys are available:
`CLIP_NAME, CUT_ITEM_NAME, SHOT, CLIP_INDEX, UUID`

The `CLIP_NAME` and `CUT_ITEM_NAME` are almost the same, but the `CUT_ITEM_NAME`
is guaranteed to be unique in a track.
For example, if there are two clips with the name `clip1`, their cut item names
will be `clip1` and `clip1_001`.

The `CLIP_INDEX` is the index of the clip in the track (starting from 1, and counting
only clips, not gaps or other elements).

The `UUID` is 6 digits long.

Even though versions with the same names are allowed, it is recommended to use keys that
guarantee the unicity of the names, like CUT_ITEM_NAME, CLIP_INDEX, or UUID.

Example valid templates:
- `{CLIP_NAME}_{UUID}` (default)
- `{CUT_ITEM_NAME}`
- `{SHOT}_{CLIP_INDEX}`
- `{CLIP_NAME}_{CLIP_INDEX:04d}` (adds some leading zeros)

#### Timecode In to Frame Mapping Mode
Different timecode in values to frame mapping modes

Three mapping modes are available, which are only relevant for straight
imports (without comparing to a previous Cut):
- `0`: Absolute. Timecode in is mapped to the Shot head in.
- `1`: Automatic. Timecode is converted to an absolute frame number.
- `2`: Relative. timecode in is converted to an arbitrary frame
number specified through settings. Example: `["00:00:00:01", 1001]`

#### Timecode In to Frame Relative Mapping.
If the Timecode In to Frame Mapping Mode is set to `2`, this setting can be used to specify
how to convert the timecode to an arbitrary frame number.

#### Use Smart Fields
If set to True, the Smart Cut Fields will be used to fill the Shot fields.

#### Shot Cut Fields Prefix
If set, the Shot Cut Fields will be custom fields that use this prefix,
e.g. `sg_PREFIX_cut_in`, `sg_PREFIX_cut_out`, etc.


#### Omitting and Reinstating Shots
If some Shots are omitted from one Cut to the other, their Status will be set
to the `shot_omit_status` setting value.
Shots which appear again in a Cut will be reinstated if their current status 
is one of the statuses set with the `reinstate_shot_if_status_is` setting.
Their status will be set to the value set with the `shot_reinstate_status` setting, 
unless it is the special "Previous Status" value. In this case the status they
had before being omitted will be set.
