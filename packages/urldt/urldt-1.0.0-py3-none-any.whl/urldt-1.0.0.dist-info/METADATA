The targets that you want to check should be put in a CSV file,
the CSV header should at least contain *url* and *title*.

For example:

```

    `urldt -f my_targets.csv` or `urldt --file my_targets.csv`

    The result will be output to the terminal in real-time.

2. output result to file
    `urldt -f my_targets.csv -o result.csv` or `urldt --file my_targets.csv --output result.csv`

    Save the available URL information into a CSV file.
