    "# ACCL Compression Support\n",
    "In general, ACCL is datatype-agnostic as most of its function involves data movement without any actual interaction with the data values themselves. However, there are two exceptions to this rule:\n",
    "* Elementwise operations (e.g. SUM) performed by ACCL instances on buffers during reduction-type collectives \n",
    "* Datatype conversions when the source and destination of a transfer are of different data types. In this scenario we call the lower-precision buffer is compressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "To support these elementwise operations and conversions, ACCL must be configured with a reduction plugin and coversion plugins respectively. Each of these plugins is a free-running Vitis kernel. Reduction plugins take two operand AXI Streams and produce one result AXI Stream, and may implement multiple functions internally, selected by an operation ID provided as side-band to the operands on the TDEST signal of AXI Stream. Conversion plugins take one operand AXI Stream as input and produce a result AXI Stream by applying an arbitrary conversion function specified by a function ID on the operand's TDEST. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example reduction and conversion plugins are provided in the ACCL repo. The example reduction plugin supports five data types: FP16/32/64 and INT32/64. The example compression plugin converts between floating-point single-precision (FP32) and half-precision (FP16). Together, these plugins enable six datatype configurations - let's see what they are:"

    "\n",
    "The key points of the ACCL datatype configuration are:\n",
    "* bytes per element for the compressed and uncompressed datatype. In the case of homogeneous configurations, these are the same datatype.\n",
    "* ratio of compressed elements to uncompressed elements, i.e. how many uncompressed buffer elements are consumed in the conversion process to produce one compressed element. For elementwise conversion e.g. FP32 to FP16, this ratio is 1. For block floating point formats, this ratio could be higher.\n",
