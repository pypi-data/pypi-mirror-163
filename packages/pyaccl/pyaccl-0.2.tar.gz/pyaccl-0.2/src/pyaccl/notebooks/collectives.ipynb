    "# ACCL Collectives\n",
    "In a system of more than one ACCL-enabled FPGAs, we can execute MPI-like collectives (scatter, gather, broadcast, reductions, etc). This notebook illustrates how to initialize the ACCL instances and run collectives. Usually, each ACCL instance runs in a separate process on a distinct compute node in a network, but for purposes of demonstration, we utilize multithreading in a single process to create and operate multiple ACCL instances"
