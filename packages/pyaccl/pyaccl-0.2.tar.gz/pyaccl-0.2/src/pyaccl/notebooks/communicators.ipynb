    "# ACCL Communicators\n",
    "ACCL send/receive primitives and collectives execute between a group of connected ranks called a communicator. The communicator is defined by the relevant properties of the ranks contained within it, most importantly the association between rank index and the Ethernet address of the rank. Multiple overlapping communicators can be defined over a group of ranks such that any one rank may be referred to by different indices in different communicators. \n",
    "\n",
    "In general, communicators allow the ACCL user to restrict their call to a specific subset of all available ranks. By default, ACCL will create and use a global communicator comprised of all ranks, but this can be split in user-defined ways, as we will see. Let's start an emulator session with 4 ACCL instances and explore this feature."
