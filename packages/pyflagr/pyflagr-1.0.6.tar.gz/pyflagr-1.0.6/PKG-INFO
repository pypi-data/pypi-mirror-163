FLAGR is a high performing, open-source, modular and cross-platform library for rank aggregation. The core FLAGR library is written in C++ and implements a wide collection of unsupervised rank aggregation methods. Its modular design allows third-party programmers to implement their own algorithms and easily integrate them within the library. FLAGR can be built as a standard console application, or as a shared library (that is, .so or .dll file). In the second case, it can be linked from other C/C++ programs, or from programs written in other languages (like Python, R, PHP, etc.).

In this context, PyFLAGR is a Python library that links to FLAGR and allows an analyst to exploit the efficient FLAGR implementations from a standard Python program.
