The interlink between these measures and the resulting change in mobility (a predictor of the disease transmission contact rate) is uncertain. We thus propose a new method for assessing the efficacy of various non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) and examine the aptness of incorporating mobility data for epidemiological modelling. Facebook mobility maps for the United Arab Emirates are used as input datasets from the first infection in the country to mid-Oct 2020. Dataset was limited to the pre-vaccination period as this paper focuses on assessing the different NPIs at an early epidemic stage when no vaccines are available and NPIs are the only way to reduce the reproduction number (). We developed a travel network density parameter  to provide an estimate of NPI impact on mobility patterns. Given the infection-fatality ratio and time lag (onset-to-death), a Bayesian probabilistic model is adapted to calculate the change in epidemic development with . Results showed that the change in  clearly impacted . The three lockdowns strongly affected the growth of transmission rate and collectively reduced  by 78% before the restrictions were eased. The model forecasted daily infections and deaths by 2% and 3% fractional errors. It also projected what-if scenarios for different implementation protocols of each NPI. The developed model can be applied to identify the most efficient NPIs for confronting new COVID-19 waves and the spread of variants, as well as for future pandemics.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>1793</offset><text>Introduction</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1806</offset><text>The rapid global spread of COVID-19 has resulted in a wide range of strategic non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) by various governments to suppress the transmission rate. These target social distancing towards limiting mobility (work-at-home initiatives, banning or limiting public events, travel restrictions, closure of schools and universities, limiting internal traffic, quarantine of symptomatic/contact individuals, etc.). The nature and extent of these measures are substantially varied between countries depending upon the intervention readiness (i.e., how quick was it applied), nature of the application, adoption rate and enforcement level. Before the rollout of vaccines, NPIs are the primary strategy to control disease spread by achieving behavioural changes in the mobility patterns of the local populace. In this context, analysing pre-vaccination epidemic data is critical to assess the efficacy of different NPIs at an early stage of a pandemic when these are the only way to reduce epidemic spread. The performance analysis of NPIs implementation provides an opportunity to make decisions for the continuous battle against COVID-19 and its variants as well as the future pandemics.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3011</offset><text>The present literature analysing NPIs effect on COVID-19 spread largely varies by the type of epidemiological model from the classic compartmental to agent-based, statistical and metapopulation models––using different types of data. All these models have attempted to assess the efficacy of NPIs by combining policy data with robust real-time disease progression trajectory data of COVID-19. For instance, used a flow-SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infection, and Recovered) model to recommend locking down high transmissibility zones. correlated COVID-19 growth curves with the controlled lockdown of air traffic in China. applied regression modelling to exhibit that mobility between highly infected zones and others is a predictor of the infection growth rate. applied a non-integer Caputo derivative technique to capture the impact of NPIs in absence of vaccines. used mobile phone geolocation data in Italy to model the changes in mobility with NPIs over time. As one of the more popular statistical models, the Bayesian model by at Imperial College London (ICL), and its variants used a discrete renewal approach for estimating the infection spread and growth in reproduction number () with each NPI.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4219</offset><text>In addition to these studies (explored more in Section 2), one of the most focused topics on NPIs is the resulting change in mobility. Despite this focus, the impact of changes in mobility patterns specifically beyond partial interlinking of regression models with compartmental or metapopulation models is uncertain. The compounding effect on the epidemic spread rate from population densities within zones in a city and the mobility through these zones is also not modelled. Even the earlier mentioned Bayesian model from ICL and its variants lacked parameterisation of the actual changes in mobility due to each modelled NPI. These mobility changes were not included in the equation for calculating the  value or the number of cases, as only a dichotomous value was assigned to each variable. One exception is the study by which used Facebook's mobility data1 to estimate the infectiousness of different population groups. However, this study did not include any calculation methods for the interrelation between spread parameters (daily cases, reproduction number, fatalities) and mobility parameters. It lacked modelling reduction in cases and deaths as a direct consequence of mobility, and a potential data-driven exit strategy towards normalcy through controlled and well-aimed NPIs.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>5511</offset><text>This paper contributes by proposing an elaboration to the Bayesian model for COVID-19 spread to identify the impact of NPIs, due to changes in mobility, on  value. The spatiotemporal fluctuations in mobility due to NPI implementation are modelled using big social media data from Facebook mobility maps1. A travel network density parameter  is developed for representing mobility, as input in the modified Cox's hazard model to estimate the effective time-variant reproduction number , and other parameters to project the daily number of infections and fatalities. The proportional effect of each NPI is assumed to be correlated with the change in  value, and the paper examines the validity of this assumption by comparing projected pandemic data with actual observations. In contrast to earlier approaches to the Bayesian epidemiological model, the impact in terms of changes in population contact rate during the pandemic has been modelled to project . These changes in contact rate are a key factor for determining the epidemic spread and are crucial for controlling epidemic spread among the local population of a country.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>6639</offset><text>The paper is organised as follows.

The  value is a ratio of transmission and recovery rates which affects the spread rate. These types of epidemiological models split the population into different compartments based on the patients’ health phases in the disease progression. Multiple variations use a different range of compartments and use some form of metapopulation, statistical or agent-based models as add-ons to calculate the impact of NPIs. For example, evaluated the interlink between outbreak trajectory and NPIs by performing simulations of the COVID-19 spread dynamics through a parameterised susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) model. Results exhibited the effectiveness of NPIs such as isolation in reducing transmissibility. fitted epidemiological data over another SEIR model for projecting the infection spread in China by integrating zoonotic introduction, public reactions and NPIs under multiple scenarios. Results showed a strong interrelation between the public behavioural response and lockdown policy measures.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>8996</offset><text> proposed a flow-SEIR model incorporating a traffic blockage factor to simulate the impact of NPIs. Simulation results showed a high correlation between traffic blockage and infection spread rate. proposed a linear variation to the SIR model by assuming a time-variant change in transmission rate due to NPIs. modified it by assuming an exponential time-variant growth similar to the Cox's proportional-hazard statistical model. In both studies, the input transmission spread parameters are obtained from Bayesian Markov-Chain models. In more detailed compartmental models, population stratification based on infection fatality ratio due to the age distribution of the population is also performed. Others focused on multiple NPI scenarios for optimal control and the return to normalcy. Each found the contact matrices to be affected by the compounding effect of multiple NPIs, recommending stricter complete lockdowns and complete school closures, among others, for optimal spread control. However, these forecasting models rely on the mechanistic cycle of disease progression from susceptible populations to infected and recovered cases and lack detailed infection-spread dynamics.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>10181</offset><text>Agent-based and metapopulation models</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>10219</offset><text>Focusing more on simulating the contact rate between different population groups, agent-based models serve to provide an assessment of the performance of different isolation measures and the nation or city-wide effect of implementing NPIs. Typically, these models track the changes in mobility of different population groups within a region using a wide range of input parameters. For instance, used mobile phone data from selected users in Seattle and New York to show that infection risk is dependent upon the characteristics of the visited location and found grocery stores, restaurants and offices as the primary spreading locations. used around 200 parameters (socio-demographics, age, comorbidities, etc.) to project the spread rate.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>10959</offset><text>Metapopulation models link compartmental models with geospatial spread dynamics of different population groups to assess the changes in mobility patterns with different NPIs. The metapopulation SEIR study by for metropolitan residents in the USA is a good example. They extended hourly mobile phone data from users to simulate their interaction at different nodes (contact points) within regions and found that reducing contact rate in potential high-risk areas is the most effective NPI. As this study and similar models contain less detailed mobility data, the aggregated mobility matrices from Google were used by to observe that strategized lockdown NPIs are highly effective in reducing spread.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>11659</offset><text>Statistical models</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>11678</offset><text>These epidemiological models are an alternative to the modelling approaches discussed in the earlier studies. According to an in-depth comparison of these models with the more popular compartmental-type models by covering 348 studies, statistical models have been applied for COVID-19 to directly quantify the impact of NPIs on the observed number of infections and fatalities compared to the expected spread data. As an early example, the correlation between human mobility and epidemic progression was noted by utilising regression modelling of pandemic data for Wuhan. Results exhibited that interzonal mobility between Wuhan and other regions is a significant indicator of the reported infection growth rate. proposed a fractional-order transmission model to assess the spread dynamics in Saudi Arabia. Results highlighted the capability of mathematical models in predicting spread dynamics and the effect of environmental parameters on the epidemic.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>12633</offset><text>The earlier mentioned Bayesian model by the ICL team is probably the most popular epidemiological model in the statistical model category. The model calculates the number of infections at any given time to be a function of the susceptible population, effective time-variant reproduction number () due to NPIs, and infected individuals in the preceding day regulated by the generation time. COVID-19 epidemic spread was modelled for eleven European countries that implemented similar NPIs for similar population distributions. It accurately accounted for the probabilistic progression trajectory of disease spread with NPIs by inferring changes in the  value, number of cases and deaths due to changes in mobility. Subsequent adoptions of this model improved upon the study by incorporating slightly larger disease spread data of an additional month, or partially substituting the uninformative prior distribution of NPI impact by Google mobility data that aggregates trends of Google Map users’ visits to grocery stores, recreational and residential facilities, workplaces and transit stations.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>13730</offset><text>A major assumption of both the ICL model and the extended study was that the NPI impact was generalised to be the same across all countries, which is rarely the case. The size of the data sample was also considerably small even after the extension as the peak of the COVID-19 cases trajectory was not yet realised and the impact of a complete lockdown was not explicitly modelled on the longer timeseries. The extended model included only part of the Google mobility data by substituting the variables for each NPI with those that represented relative changes in mobility to parks, residential and recreational facilities, etc. In addition to using only a dichotomous value for change in mobility, the same normal distribution prior was used to calculate the mobility change as used by the ICL model. Thus, transmission dynamics in these studies disregarded changes in contact between various zones within a territory collected on an individual scale and aggregated territory-wide, which might be indicative of the efficacy of any actual lockdown implementation in the studied regions.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>14816</offset><text>Contributions of this study</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>14844</offset><text>In this study, a unification of mobility data and network theory is introduced to identify the risk of contact and transmissibility between different areas (modelled as nodes) in a country, in a weighted structured mobility network. Here, a denser network is associated with a high risk. Similarly, a high concentration of people at a particular node is assumed to produce the same effect to represent the actual nature of disease spread. The ICL Bayesian model is modified and adapted to model the mobility data against epidemiological data timeseries, identified by changes on . The resulting model can describe the actual effectiveness of each NPI measurably and visually comparable to the spread dynamics graph in terms of reduction in new cases and deaths.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>15606</offset><text>Methodology</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>15618</offset><text>Location and NPIs</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>15636</offset><text>The study is conducted in the UAE. Adequate testing of the local population severely hampers the validity of any predictive model for describing the COVID-19 spread in any territory. Adjusting for the country's total population, the UAE is among the most tested countries in the world accounting for 6781.06 tests per 1000 population by December 2020, before large-scale vaccine rollouts and this large verified case spread dataset is used in this study as the epidemiological data. The UAE had its first confirmed case on January 29, 2020 and early travel restrictions were announced on February 29, 2020 followed by the closure of schools and universities, national sterilization programs/night curfews, and work-at-home initiatives. It was followed by different lockdown strategies: 24-hrs and 10-hrs lockdown, and interstate movement restrictions between Abu Dhabi and Dubai that considerably reduced the mobility of the local populace.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>16577</offset><text>Interestingly, the NPIs evaluated in datasets considered by the earlier models lacked the breadth of changes in the extent of lockdown strategies (work-at-home, night curfew, different lockdown hours, etc.) that can help decision-makers for more strategized NPIs.

Mobility patterns were reported by Facebook for three timeseries: 12 a.m.–8 a.m., 4 p.m.–12 a.m., and 8 a.m.–4 p.m. for each day, capturing regular traffic, peak, and off-peak hours for maximum dataset variability. Maps were created for each timeseries for the whole country for the entire duration of the analysis. The Facebook dataset contained information about country-wide changes compared to a pre-pandemic baseline level in the population density at each geographical zone, mobility in-out of each zone at an individual scale and geospatial information about the different zones. Aggregated anonymised data from Facebook clearly shows the variations in people's adherence to NPI-mandated lockdowns and these mobility changes are proxies for public exposure to disease spread risk as it shows the closeness of contact between individuals and the number of individuals.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">gr1.jpg</infon><infon key="id">fig1</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>21770</offset><text>A section of the mobility directional map for Abu Dhabi City on Apr 26, 2020</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">gr1.jpg</infon><infon key="id">fig1</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig</infon><offset>21847</offset><text>Fig. 1</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">gr2.jpg</infon><infon key="id">fig2</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>21855</offset><text>Trend analysis results of changes in population mobility and travel network density metric () due to NPIs.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">gr2.jpg</infon><infon key="id">fig2</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig</infon><offset>21962</offset><text>Fig. 2</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>21970</offset><text>The pseudo-code, description of the variables and the model used for determining the changes in mobility for all nodes in the network shown in Fig. 1 above are as follows:</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>22143</offset><text>Mobility model input:Travel origin-destination (OD)-matrix of people from Facebook.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>22227</offset><text>Mobility model parameters:Number of nodes, number of trip pathways between nodes (i.e., edges), in/out mobility for each node, trip loop distribution, geospatial network geometry, and population density at each node.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>22444</offset><text>Step 1:Matrix transformation: Rearranging trips into nodes (geographical zone) and edges (travel path between zones) for the entire network, containing m edges between i nodes at time :</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>22630</offset><text>Mobility model outputs:Travel network density distribution weighted by mobility-in/out and density at each node.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>22743</offset><text>Calculating the total number of nodes and edges in the network as:</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>22810</offset><text>Step 2:Graph analysis: Trip frequency  between o origin and d destination at time  is taken as input.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>22912</offset><text>Calculating weight  of edges  at time .

On the other hand, we introduce a data-driven term  (defined earlier) that provides an accurate approximation effect of mobility change due to governmental decisions associated with each NPI, unlike the  parameter by the ICL model which assumes similar value distribution for all countries.

It can be noted that the changes in mobility were more drastic compared to the  values. We propose that including the population density within the  metric acted as a normalising factor that may have contributed to a better estimation of the effects of NPIs on the epidemic spread rate, calculated through time-variant  values. Additionally, the reduction in population mobility and the  metric due to the various lockdown-centric NPIs was accompanied by a reduction in  values. Similarly, an increase in both travel pattern related variables after the curfews were lifted and lockdowns were considerably eased with only the Abu Dhabi–Dubai border being controlled, resulted in a hike noticed for the  values.

This is why the minimum values were noted when the nationwide relaxed curfew and Abu Dhabi-Dubai border closure were implemented, despite these two NPIs being a relaxation of the lockdowns, as they succeeded the two most mobility-restricting NPIs of 24-hr Dubai and 10-hr nationwide lockdown. The reason for this is that the  value in each subsequent day is dependent upon the number of infected and susceptible population weighted by a discretised distribution of serial intervals. This explains as to why the  value further dropped to levels &lt;1 after the 24-hr and 10-hr (where ) were succeeded by the easement of lockdowns as the  value and numbers of susceptible and infected individuals in the preceding days were lower. However, as the per day increase in contact rates and the resulting number of infected individuals continued to increase with the lifting of curfews, the  value also started to increase. These trends of changes in  values due to a cumulative effect follow a similar trajectory as the ICL model results. The individual effect of each NPI is explored in the what-if scenarios presented in Section 4.7.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>42995</offset><text>The model results estimated a value ranging from a posterior mean of 0.53 (95% prediction interval of 0.49–0.56) to 4.58 (95% values in the 4.0–5.07 range) based on . Our results suggest that the NPIs produced a sizeable effect in terms of reducing the transmission rate as quantified by the relative change in . As suggested earlier, the most significant impact was due to a combination of a 24-h Dubai-based lockdown and a 10-hr nationwide night-time curfew that considerably affected travel habits. We found that the  values continued a downward trajectory for the first six NPIs with an average posterior mean of 0.98, accounting for a 78% reduction compared to the pre-implementation of these NPIs as they considerably affected the travel habits of the regional population in the country.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>43793</offset><text>However, as the lockdown and other travel restrictions eased in the country, a sudden increase in mobility and density of the travel network (in comparison to the weeks when the earlier NPIs were still in place) was observed. Following the earlier discussion, this might have caused a jump in the transmission rate between the infected and susceptible population clusters within the country, as indicative through an increase in the  value. It should be noted here that despite showing a considerable impact of the  on the epidemic spread, the results cannot yet be conclusive to enlist mobility as the winner among prevention measures since vaccination, herd immunity and other epidemiological parameters are not accounted for here. Furthermore, these results do not infer that the exact NPIs that were successful in bringing  below 1 (i.e., the target value) for the case of UAE would produce the same impact in other countries.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>44724</offset><text>Nonetheless, a combination of these NPIs can serve as a guideline for measuring the influence of the herein proposed  parameter on the epidemic and the probable success rate of similar NPIs that are common to most nations (travel restrictions, night curfews, closing high mobility locations, etc.), if implemented in other countries. Interestingly, the  values measured here for the first quarter of 2020 for UAE are somewhat similar to the values for some European countries in the study using the ICL Bayesian model, where it dropped from 3.14 to 4.82 range to 0.58–0.71 post lockdown. Our results showed a re-rise in  values upon relaxing of the lockdown measures which were not observed in their study or similar studies as their studied datasets were unable to capture the increase in public mobility due to the epidemic being still in its early stages. Similarly, many NPIs were still in their implementation stages and uncertainties existed that significantly affected the models presented in these studies to link mobility with the epidemic transmission.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>45789</offset><text>Impact of NPIs on number of infections</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>45828</offset><text>Utilising the time-variant effective reproduction number  generated by the fitted model, Bayesian estimation of the infections from the start of the epidemic in the case study country to Oct 18, 2020 was obtained. Fig. 5 shows the evolution of daily infections in UAE compared to the reported number of cases for each day. From visual inspections, the model seemed to provide a good fit for the infections spread in the modelled country. In UAE, the detection rate for COVID-19 cases was second (currently fourth) in the world at 1280.19 tests per thousand inhabitants as of Oct 26, 2020 as well as top ten detection rates (tests per confirmed cases), i.e., much higher than any other country modelled in the studies predicting COVID-19 spread rates. This high level of infection ascertainment greatly increases the validation accuracy of the model results.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">gr6.jpg</infon><infon key="id">fig6</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>46687</offset><text>Model results for NPIs–implementation impact on a) daily, and b) cumulative infections based on travel network density.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">gr6.jpg</infon><infon key="id">fig6</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig</infon><offset>46809</offset><text>Fig. 6</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>46817</offset><text>Reported data shows that the daily number of infections in the UAE initially peaked on May 23, 2020 with 994 infections as shown by the grey bars in Fig. 6 after which a downward trend was noticed, dipping to 179 cases on 11 Aug. Considering our model estimates that are displayed in Fig. 6, the daily cases for 23 May were 2097 with 95% credible interval (CI) in 1846 (11% lower-bound) to 2354 (12% upper-bound) range. These model calculated results implied an overestimation of 52% compared to the observed values. On 07 June, the observed daily infections were 626 while estimated results were 1727 cases with 95% CI in the range of 1580 (9% lower-bound) to 1895 (10% upper-bound). Similarly, for 01 July the model estimated 1053 cases with 95% CI in the 963 (9% lower) to 1160 (10% upper) range. For the 11 Aug plunge, our model estimated 440 cases (95% CI: 387–495 at ±12% bound limit) which is one-and-a-half times higher than the actual cases. This CI width is representative of the variability in the population-level aggregates. A slight variation of ±2% in the interval throughout the analysis period, irrespective of the distance from the starting point, is common in epidemiological models using probabilistic serial interval and  relations where the analysis from outbreak to post-peak period was conducted. Generally, it can be proposed that the implementation of an NPI that limited the mobility of people might have also resulted in reducing the infections. However, this drop is not immediate and follows a certain degree of lag after each intervention as the cumulative effect generated a significant reduction of active cases.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>48470</offset><text>On 01 July, most lockdown measures were relaxed and only the border between the two highly populated emirates was controlled. Following some lag, this resulted in an increase in mobility accompanied by a new wave of infections peaking on Oct 18, 2020 with 1583 active infections. Our daily infection estimates for the same were 1716 cases (95% CI: 1496–1945 at ±13% bound limit), which is only 8% higher than the reported number of cases. The cumulative number of infections predicted by the model exhibited a similar trend. The model was not only capable of predicting the general trend of infection spread as well as the peaks of the epidemic outbreak with a small degree of uncertainty. These estimates suggest a good estimation rate of daily infections for our model. Additionally, both lower and upper bounds of the predicted values are well above the confirmed daily infections. Due to the shorter prediction interval, these estimates provide useful information on the prediction accuracy. It can be noted here that the difference between reported and predicted values is not several times higher compared to the other studies utilising a similar ICL Bayesian modelling approach. This indicates that a mobility parameter, particularly a time-variant travel network density, should be factored in to improve the prediction probabilities of epidemic models for COVID-19.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>49849</offset><text>Impact of NPIs on deaths</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">gr7.jpg</infon><infon key="id">fig7</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>49874</offset><text>Model results for NPIs–implementation impact on a) daily, and b) cumulative deaths based on travel network density.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">gr7.jpg</infon><infon key="id">fig7</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig</infon><offset>49992</offset><text>Fig. 7</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>50000</offset><text>Fig. 6 shows the reported number of deaths in the UAE from the first reported case to Oct 18, 2020, along with predicted time-variant fatalities according to our fitted model. On 04 Apr, our model estimated 1 death against an observed value of 1 with 95% credible interval (CI) in 0.872 (10% lower-bound) to 1.07 (10% upper-bound) range. For 22 Apr, with 3 observed deaths the model estimated 4 deaths (95% CI: 3.28–4.72 at ±18% bound limit) which further increased on 23 Apr to 5 estimated deaths (95% CI: 3.32–4.87 at ±19% bound limit) against 6 observed. Similar trends were observed for 23 May (8 estimated, 95% CI: 6.94–9.89 at ±18% bound limit), 05 June (7 estimated, 95% CI: 5.51–8.10 at ±19% bound limit), 01 July (2 estimated, 95% CI: 1.93–2.76 at ±18% bound limit), 11 Aug (1 estimated, 95% CI: 0.96–1.35 at ±17% bound limit), and 18 Oct (4 estimated, 95% CI: 3.01–4.25 at ±17% bound limit). Although there is a slight variation of ±2% between the upper- and lower-bound values from 22 Apr to the last analysis period at 18 Oct, it can be attributed to population-level aggregation and an inherent result of epidemiological prediction models as has been discussed in previous section. In general, the NPIs, particularly the two lockdowns (24-hr followed by 10-hr) were more effective in reducing the daily death toll due to the epidemic spread. This effect followed a lag period of more than 30 days, further conforming to our model assumption of 22.9 days between infection and death of individuals. The graphical representation of the daily deaths predicted by the model in Fig. 7 does not dramatically deviate from the reported daily fatalities for the studied country of the UAE.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>51725</offset><text>We assessed our estimates against reported per day deaths and found an average under-prediction error of 2 death for the first nine weeks ending on May 08, 2020 (95% CI of 3–1 deaths). After this, an average overestimation error of approximately 5 deaths or less was observed. The upper-bound overestimates included values as high as 7 deaths and the lower-bound values fell to an underestimation of 1 death. The prediction intervals for the predicted number of cumulative deaths were considerably wide. The median value for the first nine weeks since the start of the epidemic was an underestimation of 39 deaths or less (95% CI: 1–58 deaths) whereas subsequent weeks had an overestimation value as high as 129 deaths (95% CI: 3–251 deaths). Although the prediction interval is significantly wide which shows a higher uncertainty level, it is still considerably lower than those estimated by other studies where even unrealistically high numbers were reported. Nonetheless, the time-variant death trend predicted by the Bayesian model presented here using travel network density provides a strong case for representativeness of mobility-related parameters to factor in the implementation impact of countermeasures on epidemic spread among the local population of a country.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>53006</offset><text>Forecasting distribution of infections and deaths</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">gr8.jpg</infon><infon key="id">fig8</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>53056</offset><text>Forecasting results for NPIs–implementation impact on daily a) infections, and b) deaths based on travel network density.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">gr8.jpg</infon><infon key="id">fig8</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig</infon><offset>53180</offset><text>Fig. 8</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>53188</offset><text>Additional to predicting the epidemic spread rate from the beginning of the epidemic in the UAE on Jan 29, 2020 to Oct 18, 2020 by modelling the transmission contact rate among the population through detailed travel networks, the forecasting reliance of the created model was evaluated by estimating daily infections and deaths from the end of this period to Nov 30, 2020.

It appears to confirm the link between mobility and transmission contact rate, while also explaining the usability of the proposed  value in modelling the time-variant impact of NPI implementation and epidemic spread.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>55300</offset><text>Predicting epidemic progression in alternate NPI implementation scenarios</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>55374</offset><text>The actual relation between the fluctuations in effective reproduction number and NPI measures is among the key unknowns of any strategy for curtailing the epidemic spread and is attempted in several studies through empirical models. None of the studies have presented a viable parameter to identify the changes in mobility caused by these preventive actions that directly result in changing the transmission contact rate. The model presented in this study can be a useful tool for not only calculating the infections and death toll evolution due to the COVID-19 pandemic but also for predicting the potential changes in epidemiological data considering the possibility of non-implementation or extension of the different NPI measures. Some benefits of this include, painting an empirical picture of the reduction in patients and fatalities as a direct consequence of these NPIs, and a potential exit strategy directed by well-aimed and timed NPIs. The key factor for determining the NPI effect is the impact in terms of change in population contacts during this hypothetical epidemic evolution. The Bayesian model presented in this study estimates the time-variant  values by considering changes in travel network density  as an input in a modified Cox's hazard model.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">gr9.jpg</infon><infon key="id">fig9</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>56644</offset><text>Mean relative change in travel network density  with 95% CIs for each NPI compared to the pre-epidemic condition.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">gr9.jpg</infon><infon key="id">fig9</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig</infon><offset>56758</offset><text>Fig. 9</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">gr10.jpg</infon><infon key="id">fig10</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>56766</offset><text>Comparison of the Re,t values and 50% and 95% CIs between different NPI implementation scenarios for the analysed country of UAE at the baseline time horizon (Jan 29, 2020 to Oct 18, 2020) predicted by changes in network travel density.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">gr10.jpg</infon><infon key="id">fig10</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig</infon><offset>57003</offset><text>Fig. 10</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>57012</offset><text>Considering the need for an amalgamation of several deterrent NPI measures to keep the COVID-19 pandemic under control, the individual impact of each action against  values needs to be estimated that can reflect upon the success of keeping  over the long-term at the country level as we progress towards normalcy in the post-epidemic era. For this, we analysed scenarios for each NPI measure, allowing for the application of only one NPI in each scenario and estimating the change in  that could be representative of the corresponding infections and deaths attributable to COVID-19. To achieve this, the temporal distribution of  associated with the implementation of each NPI is projected over the entire analysis time horizon using their statistical distribution plots. In Fig. 9, we have presented our estimates for these  values under the seven hypothetical intervention scenarios. If  then it implies an increase in population mobility during the epidemic.

Results show that if this NPI was in place from the first case to the present,  would have been on average 406% higher at 7.2 (95% CI: 4.74–9.68). The second highest value range of 186% was in scenario 1 at  (95% CI: 2.78–5.18) where an extension of the first governmental response was presumed throughout the epidemic and ending on Oct 18, 2020. Only minor measures such as cancelling flights, dissuading mass gatherings, postponement of large public events, and closure of educational institutes were devised here.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>59197</offset><text>On the other hand, a complete border closure from scenario 6 shows considerably lower values which were 75% more than the current situation at 2.4 (95% CI: 1.58–3.07). Similar values of  (95% CI: 1.75–3.31) were computed in the 2nd scenario where it was assumed that no restrictions apart from mandating remote work and suspension of public transport is implemented. In contrast, if we assume the 3rd scenario of a 24-hr lockdown in Dubai and limited mobility in the rest of the country, we can foresee a significantly lowered  (95% CI: 0.95–1.86). Even though this range exhibits a possible scenario where the transmission rate is kept under control well before the pandemic reaches critical levels, a 24-hr long-term lockdown to limit mobility is not realistic due to substantial economic impacts. When we considered more realistic lockdown options, the two scenarios of 10-hr night-time (scenario 4) and partially restricting night-time mobility and public gatherings (scenario 5) also had low values at  (95% CI: 1.25–2.53) and  (95% CI: 1.47–2.86), respectively. This shows that although the  was falling before the lockdown through multiple small actions, potentially staying at , an extension or early implementation of the lockdown, realistically either of the two night-time lockdowns, may have resulted in a hypothetical decrement of the outbreak. These impacts are assumed considering that no alternate prevention measures have been applied, additionally, the reduction in the epidemic spread is dependent upon the early implementation date of the individual NPIs. Nonetheless, the model provided different inferences for each NPI scenario. It can be beneficial for assessing the efficacy of control measures and a controlled exit strategy may also be deducible by analysing this data under several developed scenarios with varying degrees of lockdown measures.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>61080</offset><text>Conclusion</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>61091</offset><text>Estimating the number of infections and deaths due to COVID-19 is the key to understanding the infection dynamics of the pandemic. Although many studies have scaled between the infection and fatality rates from statistical models and actual epidemic data for a target country, such strategies often depend upon several assumptions about transmission contact rates and population mobility trends that often cannot fully reflect the real situation. Many of the studies were performed over a year ago and rely on limited data ending at the start of the epidemic when the wide ranges of NPI measures were in early implementation stages and any definite associated trends or peaks were not realised. Some of the studies used realistic infection-to-death probability distributions and serial intervals based on detailed analysis of the actual epidemic spread data, yet the infections and deaths were underreported in the studied countries due to lack of testing, while the predicted values were exceptionally overestimated.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>62109</offset><text>This generates a high degree of unreliability over these results and models due to poor data quality. To address these gaps, we have developed a new algorithm for control of COVID-19 spread by merging mobility data, Bayesian epidemiological models initially proposed by the team at ICL which allows for pandemic time-series modelling through reported death toll, and network theory for geo-temporal mobility matrices. Due to the central role played by transmission contact rate in spreading the disease, a network density parameter  is introduced as a ratio between the number of individuals staying and passing through any given area. This model is expected to not only help decision-makers in establishing disease control but also help in assessing the efficacy of different control measures for an optimum NPI scenario that balances economical and epidemiological gains. It can thus also provide a solid data-driven exit strategy towards normalcy.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>63060</offset><text>The model accounts for the time-delay between infection onset and death based on reported intervals, which is also supported by the correlation analyses of  and epidemic data as an integral part of the modelling approach together with country-specific case fatality ratio (CFR) that can be readily changeable based on the analysed country. Considering the rapid change in mobility patterns due to the implementation of NPI measures, a modified hazard model is used to predict . The model assumes the entire population as susceptible without regard for immunisation or the effect of vaccination as pre-vaccination period data was used, because this paper focuses on assessing different NPIs at an early pandemic stage when no vaccines are available, and the only way to reduce the spread is through NPIs. The time-variant effective reproduction numbers are then used to calculate Bayesian probabilistic estimates of infections and deaths due to COVID-19. Owing to the high reporting accuracy of pandemic data in the UAE compared to other countries, as exhibited by it being the fourth most tested country in the world, it is used as a case study country. High data resolution daily mobility maps from Facebook are used to estimate the population density and the number of people travelling through any area at a given time is used as input for travel networks.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>64420</offset><text>This paper makes a theoretical contribution by examining the suitability of including a mobility input parameter in epidemiological modelling. Generally, NPIs were effective in changing the mobility patterns of the local population as the changes in  were highly correlated with those in . Our model estimates exhibited a strong correspondence with the observed infections and fatalities and compared to other similar models that lacked a mobility input parameter, the lower- and upper-bound values had fewer uncertainties with  infections and  deaths overestimation which suggests a strong case for using mobility-based  for accurate estimates of infections and deaths. This provides a detailed data-driven technique to track the current progression of the disease as well as project the results of the existing lockdown measures, supported by visual interlink between the observed and calculated infections and mobility fluctuations for predicting epidemic outbreak. The model created using baseline nine months data from Jan 29, 2020 to Oct 18, 2020 was used to predict a further six weeks of infections and death toll between 18 Oct and end-November 2020. The model indicated an overprediction error of  and  for daily infections and deaths, respectively. Long-term identification of effective NPI strategies is an incrementally significant policy objective. To that end, scenario modelling for each NPI implemented in the case study country is performed to provide the consequent estimates in terms of  value. The results show the applicability of our model as a useful tool for governments to dynamically adjust their counter-measures using anonymised real-time mobility data and influence the outbreak trajectory of the epidemic. In a further study, we will re-evaluate our modelling approach against data from the post-vaccination period and propose adjustment factors that consider population immunity.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">COMP_INT</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>66332</offset><text>Declaration of competing
