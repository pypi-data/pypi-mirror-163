### Sample code

```
from KEP import To_Generate_Disease,To_Generate_Key_Word,To_Generate_Location,To_Generate_All 

To_Generate_All(7824075)



# If multiple publications at a time, uncomment the following lines and replace the PMC ID:
# To_Generate_All(7824075)
# To_Generate_All(7824470)
# To_Generate_All(6988269)
# ...
```


### Input

Input the PMC ID of a publication (or a set of PMC IDs)

(For example: input "7824075" representing the publication https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7824075/)

### Output
1. The bar graph and word cloud of the key topics
