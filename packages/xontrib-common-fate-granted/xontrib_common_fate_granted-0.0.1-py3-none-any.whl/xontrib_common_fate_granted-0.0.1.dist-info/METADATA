## Prerequisites

Install [Granted](https://granted.dev) and ensure the `assumego` command is in your path already (try `which assumego`).

## Installation

To install use pip:

```bash
xpip install xontrib-common-fate-granted
# or: xpip install -U git+https://github.com/eppeters/xontrib-common-fate-granted
```

## Usage

Load the plugin in your `.xonshrc`.

e.g.:

```
xontrib load common_fate_granted
```

You can use `assume` now, just like people who use boring old shells!
