# Walking Liberty: Python 3
## Make Bitcoin/Bitcoin Cash/Bitcoin SV payments as easy as spending a Walking Liberty.

This software is provided **without warranty**. Use it at your own peril. Read the source code, understand what it does, consult with experts, etc. If you use it incorrectly or there's a bug and you lose your magic internet money, the author(s) are not liable.

## Usage

By default, uses a single-address deterministic type 1 wallet. Can use a single-address wif as well.

```
pip3 install walkingliberty


# Get address for 'satoshi'
walkingliberty address satoshi

# Get balance for 'satoshi'
walkingliberty balance satoshi

# Get balance for '5JN8q7UXFvsUTMuwePHxzd9byVGaeKvmMA6ZdV4fS4gYYiptMUc'
walkingliberty --wallet-mode wif 5JN8q7UXFvsUTMuwePHxzd9byVGaeKvmMA6ZdV4fS4gYYiptMUc balance

# Get balance for '5JN8q7UXFvsUTMuwePHxzd9byVGaeKvmMA6ZdV4fS4gYYiptMUc' in USD
walkingliberty --wallet-mode wif 5JN8q7UXFvsUTMuwePHxzd9byVGaeKvmMA6ZdV4fS4gYYiptMUc balance --unit usd

# Send 10,000 Satoshis from 'potato' to 1address
walkingliberty send potato 1address 10000

# If you want to work with Bitcoin Cash, use --currency with all calls. For example:
walkingliberty --currency bch balance satoshi
walkingliberty --currency bch send potato 1address 10000

# Bitcoin SV...
walkinglibery --currency bsv balance satoshi
walkingliberty --currency bsv send potato 1address 10000
# etc

# Get balance by address
walkingliberty --wallet-mode address balance 1address
```

Note that your phrase is likely to show up in ps output, which can be a security risk. You can control /proc access on Linux (and the equivalent systems calls on FreeBSD) with the right mount options or sysctl tunables. Probably a wise idea, anyway.
