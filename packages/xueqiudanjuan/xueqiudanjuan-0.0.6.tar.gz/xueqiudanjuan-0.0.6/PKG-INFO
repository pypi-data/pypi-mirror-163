        ## General Information
        This is a Python package designed by BugMakerH, which is used for getting the data on the XueQiu website.
        
        ## How to use this package
        ### hello
        ##### hello()
        - This function is nothing but a test for checking whether the package works well.
        ### stocks
        #### Stock
        This is a class to get data about stocks.
        You can create a Stock class using:
        ```python
        st = Stock()
        ```
        This means to create a Stock object.
        And, you can use 'get_realtime_quotec()' to get the real information of a specified stock. Like this:
        ```python
        st.get_realtime_quotec("SH000001")
        ```
