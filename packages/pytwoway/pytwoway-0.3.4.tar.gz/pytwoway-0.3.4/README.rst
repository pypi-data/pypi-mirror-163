`PyTwoWay` is the Python package associated with the following paper:

"`How Much Should we Trust Estimates of Firm Effects and Worker Sorting? <https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w27368/w27368.pdf>`_" 
by Stéphane Bonhomme, Kerstin Holzheu, Thibaut Lamadon, Elena Manresa, Magne Mogstad, and Bradley Setzler.  
No. w27368. National Bureau of Economic Research, 2020.

The package provides implementations for a series of estimators for models with two sided heterogeneity:

1. two way fixed effect estimator as proposed by `Abowd, Kramarz, and Margolis <https://doi.org/10.1111/1468-0262.00020>`_
2. homoskedastic bias correction as in `Andrews, et al. <https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-985X.2007.00533.x>`_
3. heteroskedastic bias correction as in `Kline, Saggio, and Sølvsten <https://doi.org/10.3982/ECTA16410>`_
4. group fixed estimator as in `Bonhomme, Lamadon, and Manresa <https://doi.org/10.3982/ECTA15722>`_
5. group correlated random effect as presented in the main paper
6. fixed-point revealed preference estimator as in `Sorkin <https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjy001>`_
7. non-parametric sorting estimator as in `Borovičková and Shimer <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KW0sZ4nV9bIdVhcs-UW8yW_dzUr782v5/view>`_

If you want to give it a try, you can start an example notebook for the FE estimator here: |binder_fe| for the CRE estimator here: |binder_cre| for the BLM estimator here: |binder_blm| for the Sorkin estimator here: |binder_sorkin| and for the Borovickova-Shimer estimator here: |binder_bs|. These start fully interactive notebooks with simple examples that simulate data and run the estimators.

The code is relatively efficient. Solving large sparse linear models relies on `PyAMG <https://github.com/pyamg/pyamg>`_. This is the code we use to estimate the different decompositions on US data. Data cleaning is handled by `BipartitePandas <https://github.com/tlamadon/bipartitepandas/>`_.

The package provides a Python interface. Installation is handled by `pip` or `Conda` (TBD). The source of the package is available on GitHub at `PyTwoWay <https://github.com/tlamadon/pytwoway>`_. The online documentation is hosted `here <https://tlamadon.github.io/pytwoway/>`_.

Development
-----------

If you want to contribute to the package, the easiest way is to use poetry to set up a local environment::

    poetry install
    poetry run python -m pytest

To push the package to PiP, increase the version number in the `pyproject.toml` file and then::

    poetry build
    poetry publish

Finally to build the package for conda and upload it::

    conda skeleton pypi pytwoway
    conda config --set anaconda_upload yes
    conda-build pytwoway -c tlamadon --output-folder pytwoway
