Description: # PyEmission
        Python Library for Vehicular Emission Estimation (PyEmission)
        
        PyEmission is a Python library for estimation of gasoline vehicular emissions and fuel consumption. This tool covers a wide range of light duty motor vehicles including passenger car, SUV, passenger truck, and light commercial truck. The tool only takes second-by-second driving cycle and vehicle characteristics data as inputs and generate results of vehicular emissions (CO2, CO, NOx, and HC) and fuel consumption.
        
        A detailed description of this software methodology can be found in this [Journal Article](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.128931).
