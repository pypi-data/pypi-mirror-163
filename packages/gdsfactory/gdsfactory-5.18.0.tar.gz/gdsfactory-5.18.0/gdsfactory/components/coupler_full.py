    """Adiabatic Full Coupler.

    Design based on asymmetric adiabatic full
    coupler designs, such as the one reported in 'Integrated Optic Adiabatic
    Devices on Silicon' by Y. Shani, et al (IEEE Journal of Quantum
    Electronics, Vol. 27, No. 3 March 1991).

    Region I is the first half of the input S-bend straight where the
    input straights widths taper by +dw and -dw,
    Region II is the second half of the S-bend straight with constant,
    unbalanced widths,
    Region III is the coupling region where the straights from unbalanced widths to
    balanced widths to reverse polarity unbalanced widths,
    Region IV is the fixed width straight that curves away from the coupling region,
    Region V is the final curve where the straights taper back to the regular width
    specified in the straight template.

    Args:
        length: Length of the coupling region.
        gap: Distance between the two straights.
        dw: Change in straight width. Top arm tapers to width - dw, bottom to width - dw.
        angle: Angle in radians at which the straight bends towards the coupling region.
        parity (integer -1 or 1): If -1, mirror-flips the structure so that input port
         is actually the *bottom* port.
        port: Cartesian coordinate for input port
            (AT TOP if parity=1, AT BOTTOM if parity=-1).
        direction: Direction that the component points *towards*,
         can be of type NORTH, WEST, SOUTH, EAST, OR an angle (float in radians).
        waveguide_template: function that returns Picwriter WaveguideTemplate object
