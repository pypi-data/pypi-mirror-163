# Voiceflow Python Package

This is an unofficial Python package for an easy use of the [Voiceflow API.](https://www.voiceflow.com/api/dialog-manager)

#### Basic usage
In your virtual environment:
```text
pip install voiceflow
```
Then in your Python code:
```python
import os
from voiceflow import Voiceflow

vf = Voiceflow(
    api_key=os.getenv('VOICEFLOW_API_KEY'),
    user_id='abc123'
)

# Launch the agent
vf_response = vf.interact.launch()

# Send a simple text input
vf_response = vf.interact.text(user_input='hello')


```
Pass the version of your Voiceflow project to contact.
It can be __development__ (default) or __production__.
```python
vf = Voiceflow(
    api_key=os.getenv('VOICEFLOW_API_KEY'),
    user_id='abc123',
    version_id='production'
)
```

You can also call __launch()__ or __text()__ with your custom
__config__:
```python
vf_response = vf.interact.launch(config={'stripSSML': False})
```
Default __config__ values:
```python
{
    'tts': False,
    'stripSSML': True,
    'stopAll': True,
    'stopTypes': [],
    'excludeTypes': [
        'block',
        'debug',
        'flow',
    ]
}
```

#### User State:
```python
# Fetch the user's current state
vf_response = vf.user_state.fetch()

# NotImplemented:
# Update the user's current state.
# Delete all state and session data for user.
```

#### Variables:
```python
variables = {
    'test1': 'one',
    'test2': 2,
}
vf_response = vf.variables.update(variables=variables)
```
