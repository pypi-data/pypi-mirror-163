            If not, path will be inferred. Build and dist folders will be created in same directory.

        clean (bool, optional): Whether delete created build and dist folders.
        verbosity (Literal[0, 1, 2], optional): If 0, prints nothing, if 1, then one line description of what
            happened is printed. If 3, all the results from terminal are printed. Defaults to 1.
        pep517 (bool, optional): Whether using PEP 517, that use pyproject.toml to build distribution. Without
            it it's faster, but with it, pyproject.TOML can be used. Defaults to False.
        venv (None | Venv): Venv used for building distribution. Defaults to Venv("venv").
