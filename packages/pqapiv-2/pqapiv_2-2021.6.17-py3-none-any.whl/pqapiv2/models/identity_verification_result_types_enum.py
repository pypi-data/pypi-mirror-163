    In combination with the <i>Disposition</i> type, the <i>Result</i> type
    provides the results of an IDV check. A <i>Dispositioned</i> result of
    <i>FINAL PASS</i> represents a passing check, whereas a <i>TRANSIENT
    FAIL</i> is still being processed but has failed at least one phase of the
    check. Until the disposition is <i>FINAL</i>, a result has not been
    determined.

        PASS: TODO: type description here.
        FAIL: TODO: type description here.
        SERVICE_OFFLINE: TODO: type description here.
        PROCESSING: TODO: type description here.
