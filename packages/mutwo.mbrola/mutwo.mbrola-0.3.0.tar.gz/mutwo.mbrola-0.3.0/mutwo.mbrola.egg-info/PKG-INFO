Mbrola extension for [mutwo](https://github.com/mutwo-org/mutwo).

### Installation

mutwo.mbrola is available on [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/mutwo.mbrola/) and can be installed via pip:

```sh
pip3 install mutwo.mbrola
```

### Limitations

Mbrola has problems with long durations of single phonemes (longer than around 8 seconds).
Sometimes it will just produce empty sound files in this case.
It is not clear yet what's the border, maybe in the mbrola documentation one can find more about this.
