The Python ARM Radar Toolkit, Py-ART, is an open source Python module containing
a growing collection of weather radar algorithms and utilities build on top of
the Scientific Python stack and distributed under the 3-Clause BSD license.
Py-ART is used by the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Climate Research
Facility for working with data from a number of precipitation and cloud radars,
but has been designed so that it can be used by others in the radar and
atmospheric communities to examine, processes, and analyse data from many types
of weather radars.
