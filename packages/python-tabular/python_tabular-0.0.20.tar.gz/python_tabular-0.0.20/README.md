### What is it?

PyTabular is a python package that allows for programmatic execution on your tabular models! This is possible thanks to [Pythonnet](https://pythonnet.github.io/) and Microsoft's [.Net APIs on Azure Analysis Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.analysisservices?view=analysisservices-dotnet). The package should have the dll files included when you import it. 

### Getting Started

```powershell
python3 -m pip install python_tabular
```

In your python environment, import pytabular and call the main Tabular Class. Only parameter needed is a solid connection string.

```python
    import pytabular
    model = pytabular.Tabular(CONNECTION_STR)
```

DAX Query

```python
    model.Query(DAX_QUERY)
    # Returns a Pandas DataFrame
```

Refresh Tables and Partitions

```python
    #filter down the collection to what you want to refresh
    tables_to_refresh = [table for table in model.Tables if table.Name in ['Table1','Table2','Table3']]
    
    #Queue up the tables and partitions that you want to refresh.
    model.Refresh(tables_to_refresh)

    #Once you are ready, update to execute the refresh
    model.Update()
```

Built In Dax Query Helpers
```python

    #Query Every Column
    model.Query_Every_Column() #Will return pd.DataFrame()

    #Query Every Table
    model.Query_Every_Table() #Will return pd.DataFrame()
    
    '''
    NOTE, notice the default values for the query_function argument. 
    Query_Every_Column will get COUNTROWS(VALUES(_))
    and Query_Every_Table() will get COUNTROWS(_)
    with '_' being replaced with the dax identifier to the table or column in question.
    You can replace this str with anything you want. For example output the MIN(_) or MAX(_) of each column rather than the default queries.
    '''
```

Backup & Revert a Table in Memory
```python
    model.Backup_Table('TableName') #This will backup the table with surround items (columns,measures,relationships,roles,hierarchies,etc.) and will add a suffix of '_backup'
    #Make any changes to your original table and then revert or delete backup as necessary
    model.Revert_Table('TableName') #This will essentially replace your original with _backup
```

Run BPA from TE2
```python
    TE2 = pytabular.TE2() #Feel free to input your TE2 File path or this will download for you.
    BPA = pytabular.BPA() #Fee free to input your own BPA file or this will download for you from: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/Analysis-Services/master/BestPracticeRules/BPARules.json
    model.Analyze_BPA(TE2.EXE_Path,BPA.Location) #This will output a list of BPA violations...
```

I'm working on converting everything to the google docstring format and using those to populate the documentation. I still have some formatting issues to work through, but that should help with understanding what this package can do.
