## Ankify

A tiny CLI to help me convert my notes to Anki-importable CSV's. I prefer to take notes in vim and maintain them in txt files for easy editing and searching, and I want notes to be highly readable both in their original text files and also in Anki. My attempts to follow the Anki docs about multi-line answers either results in horribly unreadable text files or parsing errors when importing cards into the app, so this is my workaround. Eventually I may update this to import the newly generated csv(s) into anki automatically.
