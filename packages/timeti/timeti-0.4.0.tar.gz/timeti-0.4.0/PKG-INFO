### Experience

### Install 
```
pip install timeti
```

### Usage
- Profile function with decorator
  ```python
  >>> @timeti.profiler
  ... def ultimative_question(*args, **kwargs):
  ...     sum(range(100_000))
  ... 
  >>> ultimative_question()
  Elapsed time of 'ultimative_question' function: 4 ms
  ```

- Profile loop with wrap
  ```python
  >>> for i in timeti.profiler(range(2)):
  ...     _ = sum(range(100_000))
  ... 
  Elapsed time of loop iteration 0: 4 ms
  Elapsed time of loop iteration 1: 3 ms
  Elapsed time of loop: 8 ms
  ```

- Profile code blocks with context manager 
  ```python
  >>> with timeti.profiler():
  ...     _ = sum(range(100_000))
  ... 
  Elapsed time of block: 5 ms
  ```


## Development

### Install 
```
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Run linters

- Format Python code with [black](https://github.com/psf/black)
  ```
  python -m black .
  ```

- Check types with [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/)
  ```
  python -m mypy .
  ```

- Sort imports alphabetically with [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/)
  ```
  python -m isort .
  ```
  
- Analyze Python docstring with [pydocstyle](http://www.pydocstyle.org/en/stable/) 
  ```
  python -m pydocstyle .
  ```

### Run tests  

- Run tests   
  ```  
  python -m unittest discover -s tests  
  ```  

- Run doctests for clock face  
  ```  
  python -m doctest -v timeti/clockface.py  
  ```
